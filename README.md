The following technologies were used to make this game:
  -React.js
  -Mongo d
  -Material-UI for React
  
## What if I want to clone it and add my own code?

- First download and install Mongo Database
- Then open a terminal window and type
bash
```
$ mongod
```
- Then Clone the repository and cd into the folder

bash
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ryanccrawford/black-react.git
```
bash
```
$ cd black-react
```

- Next run npm install. This was made using create-react-app so it should cd automatically into the client folder and download all the required npm packages

bash
```
$ npm install
```
- Then to run make sure you are back in the root of black-react, then run this command

bash
```
$ npm start
```


TODO:
Finish the dealers turn / Right now when you play, hitting the 'STAY' button will cause the game to just stop. This is because there is no code yet to eveluate the dealers turn.
Will Update soon
